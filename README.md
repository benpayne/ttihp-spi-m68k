# 68k SPI Bridge (TinyTapeout IHP 26b)

A hardware SPI master bridge for a 68k-based retrocomputer, targeting the Tiny Tapeout ihp-26b shuttle (IHP SG13G2, 130nm BiCMOS). Exposes itself as a memory-mapped 68k peripheral so the CPU can talk to external SPI memory (flash/EEPROM/FRAM, SD cards) without bit-banging.

**Start here:** [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for project context, then [docs/design/spi-i2c-bridge.md](docs/design/spi-i2c-bridge.md) and [docs/design/68k-bus-interface.md](docs/design/68k-bus-interface.md) for the full spec. Nothing has been implemented yet — `src/project.v` is currently a placeholder.

Sibling project: [ttihp-sound-m68k](https://github.com/benpayne/ttihp-sound-m68k) (sound chip, same 68k bus interface). Prior art: [ttihp-ps2-m68k](https://github.com/benpayne/ttihp-ps2-m68k) (PS/2 decoder, same retrocomputer, same shuttle).

## What is Tiny Tapeout?

Tiny Tapeout is an educational project that aims to make it easier and cheaper than ever to get your digital and analog designs manufactured on a real chip.

To learn more and get started, visit https://tinytapeout.com.

## Set up your Verilog project

1. Add your Verilog files to the `src` folder.
2. Edit the [info.yaml](info.yaml) and update information about your project, paying special attention to the `source_files` and `top_module` properties. If you are upgrading an existing Tiny Tapeout project, check out our [online info.yaml migration tool](https://tinytapeout.github.io/tt-yaml-upgrade-tool/).
3. Edit [docs/info.md](docs/info.md) and add a description of your project.
4. Adapt the testbench to your design. See [test/README.md](test/README.md) for more information.

The GitHub action will automatically build the ASIC files using [LibreLane](https://www.zerotoasiccourse.com/terminology/librelane/).
